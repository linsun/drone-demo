## LLaVA

 The first image is more engaging due to the presence of a person with an expressive face, likely looking directly at the camera, which creates a sense of connection and interaction. In contrast, the second image features a static, empty desk with papers, which lacks the human element and thus appears less engaging as it gives no immediate impression of a conversation or interaction.

10-word summary: The first image is more engaging because it has a person in it, creating an atmosphere of connection and interaction, while the second image lacks human presence and seems less dynamic. 

## Qwen3-VL

First image lacks clarity and human elements; second shows a vibrant, organized workspace with tech tools, lighting, and context. Second is more engaging.
