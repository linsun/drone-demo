## LLaVA

 The first image has a stronger engagement due to the woman's expressive facial expression and the use of lighting that highlights her features. In contrast, the second image is less engaging because it shows less facial expression and has darker and less dynamic lighting. 

## Qwen3-VL

Second image: brighter smile, hand near chin (expressive). First has reserved nose gesture. Second’s warmth boosts engagement.  
Smile + gesture make second image more engaging.
